R10.5
Event Object:
-An event is a action performed by a user that may prompt a response from a program.
Event Source: 
-An even source is a user interface component that generates a particular event. 
Event Listener: 
-Event listener objects are instances of classes that contain methods that provide instructions that need to be executed when events occur.

R10.6
Usually when the user preforms an action, an event source, corresponding to the user’s action, calls methods of an event listener class. 

R10.11
-There are two advantages to putting event listeners inside inner classes
1) Since listener classes tend to be short, its better in terms of organizing code. 
2) Inner class methods can access instances variables and methods of surrounding class. 

-If Java did not have inner classes, we would implement event listeners in the frame. (Usually considered a bad technique) 
  
R10.14
Name a method that is declared in JTextArea
-Append method is declared in JTextArea. 

A method that JTextArea inherits from JTextComponenet 
- JTextArea inherits setText method. 

A method that JTextArea inherits from JComponent
-JComponent is an abstract class. JTextArea inherits getHeight method from it. 

R10.22
In the Italian Flag example, colors are set as follows: 
g.setColor(Color.GREEN)
g.setColor(Color.RED)
- I would change color attributes to whatever colors I want draw the flag with: 
i.e. Color.BLUE or Color.YELLOW …. 

R11.2 
Layout managers expand each component to fill the entire allotted area, which makes 
the layout look good an saves collocating time. 

R11.11
More then one checked box can be checked at a time, but only one radio button can be 
pressed at a time. Because check box settings settings do not exclude each other, you do not place a set of checked boxes inside a radio group. 

R11.19 
What is the difference between action event and mouse event?
Mouse events are processed via Mouse Listeners which are usually more complex then action
listeners. Mouse Listener interface has five different methods to process events and all fives methods of the interfaces must be implemented even if some methods are implemented as do-nothing methods. 

R11.20
ActionListener interface has only one methods to process an ActionEvent: actionPerformed 
MouseListener interface has the following methods to process events: 
mousePressed, mouseRelease, mouseClicked, mouseEntered and mouseExited. 

R11.21 
MouseListener has  bigger variety of events that it can process.

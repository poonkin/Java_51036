Pseudo code is important in Java 
While writing pseudo code indent if there is an if statement/ or loop INDENT

Ternary in java e1 : e1 ? e2 : e3 

Every Class in Java inherits from Object Class

Java virtual machine is developed for every operating system . In Java, when one compiles
a piece of code, it churns out a .class file that talks 

Wrapper Classes:
Correspond to primitives, all primitives have a wrapper class

String Pools
Java can sometimes pool strings together 

substring - GO OVER, will be on the exam

Advantages of Array:
Accessing array in very fast 
Disadvantage is that they have fixed length


ArrayList can be used to fiddle with that  - its an array thats implemented as List, no limit of size 

Disadvantage, when you run out of space, double the array is expensive. 


When declaring and initializing a an ArrayList, declare its type 

Every Array knows its length 

Array.length - is a property not a method

Primitives VS Objects
——————————

Heap - portion of memory set aside for an object 

A class is a blue print 

Constructors - the only method in a class that must be Capitalized
Must be capitalized, must have the same name as class, can be overloaded - (i.e. two methods with a same name but different signatures) 
i.e. a Class can have a constructor with no arguments and a construct with a multiple arguments

If no constructor is explicitly initiated, a constructor will be implicitly provided 

Shortcut of main - main + cntrl J 

There is always an implicit constructor in all Java programs

Objects get Extentiated on the HEAP

Stack is only sure for something thats used locally 

————————————————————————
Java Program 

Driver -has a main method  

Create a bunch of Objects and manipulate them 
——————————————

Static is important 

toString methods can be created on every class 

IMPLICIT PARAMETER VS EXPLICIT PARAMETER, will be on the exam 
when you call methods from a static context no need for implicit parameter
Instance methods are called on implicit parameters which are references to objects on a heap


Static Method is Called on a CLASS 
instance Methods are Called on a instance 

Constants are usually capitalized 

Packages - READ ABOUT THIS…

The most important function of a package is to disambiguate a class 
In order to reference a class and its methods, we need to explicitly reference a package 
where its coming from. 

Passing to method a primitive, you pass by value 
you pass by value 
Primitives are passed by value 


Passing by reference can mutate the value in the object  
You can mutate the object

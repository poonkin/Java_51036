RULES OF JAVA 

-Only concrete classes can be instantiated 
-Type of any object on the heap must be of a concrete class 

int x = 14/5; 
x is 2. 


primitive can be Boxed into an object (its wrapper class)
ie. Double x = (double) 4589; 

You can cast a primitive of a smaller size into a larger primitive

JAVA event Model

ModeL 

There is an event source: i.e. a button 
When you click a button, it generates an an action event (throws an event) 
You can create and event listener that uses interfaces to catch the event 

ANY class that implements the lintier interface can be a listener

Listener must listening to correct events 

Event source must correspond to event listener

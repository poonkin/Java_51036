What is a heap?

A heap is a data structure that is looks like a binary tree which is in order. It also has to be balanced. The reason heap is used is because its search function is O(lon(g));
A heap is an area of memory reserved for data that is created at runtime. Used for OBJECTS 

A Stack is an area of memory used for date whose size can be determined when the program is compiled.

What is a utility class? 
What is a utility method?


cloning method of Object will be on the midterm. (GO OVER IT)

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated 
Abstract classes are good for polymorphism

Go over toString method 

Autoboxing 

Overloading - same name, but different signature, type or number of parameters
Return type does not effect Overloading 

this key words refers to the instance of object at runtime

VarArgs allows  you to have as many parameters of a function as you like and it it can be of any TYPE but it has to be LAST

Go OVER interfaces

Interface vs Abstract Class

An interface is a contract
When an object interfaces many interfaces, you are telling the compiler that you will override these methods 


An abstract method: like an interfaces it cannot be 
It can have methods,
its can private attributes 

When you use an abstract class, you only extend ONE abstract class
but you can you extend many interfacesâ€¦

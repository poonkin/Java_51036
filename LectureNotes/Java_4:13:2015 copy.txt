Polymorphism - the most important part of object oriented programming 

As you move down the object heiarachy, the object at the bottom of the pyramid inherits everything from the top of the pyramid 

Every object inherits from “Object” 

SHIFT+CONTROL+ALT+U shows a uml diagram 

Interface - a contract that says that methods should be within interfaces must be over written as it gets inherited 

Rules: 

1. reference type of the same type


obj.getClass() gets the type of a class

instance of - checks the type of object 

Interfaces - A class implements an interface rather then extends it. 

A class extends a super class and inherits everything from it 


A super class in less complex then a subclass 
A sub class in more complex then a superclass

You must always use “extends key word”

Abstract 

Abstract class is a lot like interfaces
Abstract method has as signature but no body.

Java can only extends from one parent

Go over abstract classes

Go over keyword “implements” 

Don’t worry about checking exceptions

Checked exceptions MUST be handled

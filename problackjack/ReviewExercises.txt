R13.1 
a. Recursion - a programming method for solving problems in which a method calls itself and passes to itself a smaller version of the same problem until a base case is reached  
b. Iteration - a way of solving problems by repeating a set of instructions
c. Infinite recursion - method that calls itself until it runs out of memory. 
d. Recursion helper method - are recursive methods that are used to solve problems that are similar to origin problems but are modified in a way that makes applying recursion to them easier.

R13.3
One of the solutions for sorting an array of numbers would be merge sort;
Give an array of numbers, the array keeps getting divided until you have a collections 
of array with size one. The you recombine these arrays, but as you recombine them 
you put the elements in a correct order. 


13.6 

power( number, power)
if power = 0 
	return 1 
else 
   factor = power(number, (int) power/2)
	if power%2 == 0; 
          	return factor*factor; 
    	else 
		return factor*factor*number 


R13.8
int fact(int k){

	int result - 0;  
	if ( n == 0 or n == 1) 
	    return 1; 
	else
	    result = result + fact(k -1) ; 
	
	return result;
}
